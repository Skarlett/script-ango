# NOTICE
## All files need modifications to work
None of these files are updated and many link back to old repositories,
you'll need to dig through this grab bag of stuff to maintain any profile you'd like.

maintence includes

changing urls pointing to `https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108390498/Code/Templates/CSS/Ice.css` (Dropbox)

You will need to replace that url, to the appriotate css file, which you can also find in this repo.`
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skarlett/script-ango/master/css/Death/Death.css`

There is also probably many duplicate files, as I was not good at version control as a kid (and possibly even now).

Since I'm no longer maintaining these, you might want to learn a tiny bit of css, and html yourself to maintain them personally.

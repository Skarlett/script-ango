<p class="Vanrod"><font face="arial" size="1">V'anrod (Vhey-an-rode) , The blade used by Lyend, Vi Victorian. The blade Gathers it name by the first who made it, V'si (Vhey-sigh), a master who died earily on in making blades. V'anrod was his blade of perfence in all of his battles, but in a battle with him and a Demon named Worm, he had been severely injured. Slowly dying, he had given the sword off to a corrupt soldier who only desired power, using the blade as a way to gain power. Longer on this soldier became the leader of his cult known as "Cyther" (Si-ther), and all who were in the group were given a small portion of the blade's power. Lyend being part of this cult, he slowly advanced in the ranks of the 9 users. The sword was enchanted with the powers of Shadow and hate, and the Demon who's soul was invested in the Blade was known as Divinarex. She had found a strange hate in Lyend and soon terrorized him all the way until he had assassinated the leader, Cyther. Claiming the blade as his own, she had taken over his soul with her own, he had killed off all the Cythers using the blades power reclaiming the power that had perviously belonged to the blade. Lyend had blacked out fro many years allowing Divinarex complete power. One day he decided to rebel within his own self conscience. Winning the fight between the two, he added a chain to the blade in which he synced Divinarex's soul in. This gave him the choice to choose how much power he wanted from the blade but the trade off of how much power he gave her to his body.</p>

<img class="image2" src="http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb479/DawningShadow/Lyend11.jpg" width="645" height="120" /><p class="Vanrod"><font face="arial" size="1" color="#ffffff">"My heart is filled with Hate" Divinarex said in the mist of Fire and flame, Lyend's mind vision reanimating from black to white, before flashing back to normal. Blood Drizzling down his cheek, he held a hand to his hand as he tried to crawl to his knees. Falling back down his eyes trailed up at her. She looked dwon upon him as she withdrew V'anrod slicing it into the ground next to him.</P><p class="bio">
His eyes awoke from his dreams as he went back to thinking about how it all started. Lyend had started out as a normal boy before everything. His original name wasn't Lyend, it was Lynn. There had been a traggic accident with a killer loose in his school, the killer was armed with a gun. The killer had came into the froom where Lyend was hidden in, Lyend attempted to save another's life by jumping on the back of the killer strangling him into a choke hold. In the hussle, the killer had shot his own knee. Lyend had stolen the gun, and he had murdered the killer. Soon people began afraid of him, and he didn't want anyone to know, so he murdered the rest of them. It was him, his girlfriend and his best friend left. Divinarex appeared towards him whispering in his ears about all the times she had betrayed him for others and how she had lied to him. Only he could hear her though as he screamed at them both. Lyend Falling apart mentally turned around to see the swat team entering the room, turning back to them, he shot her and turned to shoot the officer. Divinarex tempting him more to kill his friend, he turned to him and pulled the trigger. But no shot was extingished. She had promised his survival if he killed him. He had strangled him to death, and as she kept her promise. He made it out alive. Cyther had found him and ranked him as number 10 in his ranks hiding him and Shealtering him. Lyend found the same hatred in his heart again for Cyther later on in the next few years and murdered him with great struggle and the rest of the members.</p></div>
